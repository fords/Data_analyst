## Summary
The data visualization made tends to explore the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic. The graphs show the survival chances depending upon gender, age, port from which the person embarked and passenger class. I have also explored the age and and price fare of passengers aboard the Titanic and tried to relate the survival according to it.

## Design
Each factor( Age Group, Ticket Class, Gender , Embarked from) with survival rate of the passenger is considered.
The bar charts are for comparing the effect each factor is on survival rates. average survival rate is put on vertical axis and each factor( Age Group, Ticket Class, Gender , Embarked from) in horizaontal axis to compare with the survival rate
The full place names cleary show the readers what the places passengers embarked from. The gender filters allowed user to compare who survived more. 
The survival rate instead of counts make visually easier to understand the survivors' data. 

## Feedback
* In Survived visualization, there is no clear label
  * I changed 0 to dead and 1 to alive

* Age figures are sloppy.
  * I put histograms in three categories.

* In class visualization, it is not clear how many survive out of what total number of people in each class.
  * I changed to percentage.

* In Embarked visualization, there is no explanation for null and C, Q, S?
  * I speciied the towns accordingly.

*Embarked Graph could be visually better in presentation
  *I adjusted the size of the figure.

*There is no text explanation.
  *I put explanations.

*Gender Graph could be visually better in presentation
  *I adjusted the size of the figure
